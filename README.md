# Sales-report-PowerBI Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Sales-report-PowerBI project was initiated to streamline and automate the process of handling financial data received via emails within a fintech organization. The manual tasks involved downloading, cleaning, and visualizing data, leading to significant time and resource consumption. The project's primary objective was to extract email attachments without opening emails and create insightful reports using Power BI.

## Problem Statement

In the organization, a dedicated team of 10 members faced challenges related to handling monthly financial data received via emails. Their tasks included data download, cleaning, data massaging, understanding data issues, combining hourly data, and creating visually appealing reports in Excel. This manual and labor-intensive process consumed a substantial amount of time and organizational resources.

**Key Challenges:**
- Manual data handling and cleaning.
- Time-consuming report creation in Excel.
- Significant resource allocation for routine tasks.

## Solution

The solution focused on automating the extraction of email attachments and leveraging Power BI for efficient report creation.

## Steps to be Followed

1. **Create a New Folder in Microsoft Outlook:**
   - Establish a dedicated folder in Microsoft Outlook to organize and store emails containing relevant financial data.

2. **Create a New Rule:**
   - Implement a rule in Outlook to automatically filter and move emails with specific criteria to the designated folder. This step enhanced the organization of incoming data-related emails.

3. **Connect Outlook Account to Power BI Account:**
   - Establish a seamless connection between the Outlook account and Power BI account for efficient data integration.

4. **Load and Transform Data:**
   - Utilize Power BI to load and transform data from the designated Outlook folder. This involved cleaning and preparing the data for visualization.

5. **Import Only Files Attached to Emails:**
   - Extract and import only the files attached to the emails, excluding unnecessary columns or content. This step focused on efficiently handling relevant data.

6. **Build a Beautiful Report:**
   - Leverage Power BI's visualization tools to create engaging and informative reports. Various visual elements, including maps, stacked barcharts, area charts, donut charts, pie charts, scrollers, and different
     cards, were utilized for comprehensive insights.

7. **Publish and Share:**
   - Publish the finalized Power BI report and share it with relevant stakeholders. This ensured easy access to insights derived from the data.
